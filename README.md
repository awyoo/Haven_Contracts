## 🎯 The Problem

Smartphone theft in emerging markets is a **$1B+ problem**. In Lagos alone, a stolen phone is wiped, re-flashed, and resold in secondary markets within hours. Existing solutions — IMEI blacklists, Find My Phone, carrier locks — are **reactive, centralized, and easily circumvented**.

The black market wins because the economics favor it: a fence pays cash immediately, and the infrastructure to verify stolen goods simply doesn't exist at the point of sale.

## 💡 The Haven Solution

Haven doesn't track stolen devices. Haven makes them **economically worthless** to the black market by fundamentally changing the incentive structure:

1. **Bind devices to on-chain identities** — SHA-256 hashed IMEIs become stateful Soroban assets. The raw IMEI never touches the chain.
2. **Offer trustless bounties that outbid the black market** — When a device is stolen, the owner locks a USDC bounty in a Soroban escrow contract. A vendor or finder who returns the device gets paid automatically — no trust, no middlemen.
3. **Provide cryptographic proof-of-loss for insurers** — Immutable on-chain evidence eliminates double-dipping fraud and gives insurance providers a verifiable claims layer.

### Core Data Flow

| Step | Action | Layer |
|------|--------|-------|
| **1. Register** | User enters IMEI → API route hashes it (SHA-256) → Soroban stores the hash as a `DeviceState` | On-chain |
| **2. Killswitch** | Owner reports stolen → Contract freezes the asset → USDC bounty deposited to escrow | On-chain |
| **3. Fund Bounty** | Owner clicks "Fund with Bank Transfer" → SEP-24 Anchor handles Naira → USDC conversion → Funds hit escrow | Fiat → On-chain |
| **4. Recovery** | Finder contacts owner → Owner confirms → Contract releases bounty to finder's Stellar address | On-chain |
| **5. Insurance** | Owner files claim → Contract transfers device authority to insurer → Immutable proof-of-loss generated | On-chain |

## 🔑 Why Stellar?

Haven is purpose-built for Stellar because no other chain provides this combination of features for our specific market:

### Native USDC (Circle)

Bounties are priced in **stable USDC**, not volatile tokens. A finder in Computer Village, Lagos knows *exactly* what they'll earn for returning a device — $20, not "0.003 ETH that might be $18 or $22 by the time they cash out."

### SEP-24 Fiat On-Ramps — The Killer Feature

This is what makes Haven work in Nigeria (and any emerging market):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  The Bounty Funding Flow                      │
│                                                               │
│  1. User clicks "Fund Bounty with Bank Transfer"              │
│  2. Haven authenticates user with Anchor (SEP-10)             │
│  3. Anchor returns a URL → opens in-app webview               │
│  4. User makes a standard Naira bank transfer to Anchor       │
│  5. Anchor drops equivalent USDC into Soroban escrow          │
│                                                               │
│  Result: User funded a crypto escrow using their local        │
│  bank account. No exchange. No bridge. No seed phrase.        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Zero KYC/compliance liability** for Haven — the Anchor handles all regulatory requirements
- **Users stay inside the Haven app** — no redirect to a third-party exchange
- **Instant global scaling** — implement SEP-24 once, connect to any compliant Anchor worldwide. Expand to Kenya or Ghana without rewriting your payment gateway.

### Account Abstraction & Smart Wallets

Stellar has **native account abstraction** via Soroban's programmable `__check_auth`. Haven uses:

| Tool | Purpose | Equivalent |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Passkey Kit** | WebAuthn/biometric smart wallets — users sign with FaceID or fingerprint | Privy embedded wallets |
| **Launchtube** | Fee abstraction relay — sponsors transaction fees for users | Paymaster / gas sponsorship |
| **Freighter** | Browser extension wallet for B2B integrations (insurance providers, vendors) | MetaMask / Phantom |

No seed phrases. No gas tokens. A user signs up with a biometric passkey, and a Stellar keypair is generated under the hood.

### Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Registering a device on Haven costs fractions of a cent. This is critical for mass-market adoption in price-sensitive markets.

### Enterprise Trust

When pitching Haven to insurance providers as their proof-of-loss infrastructure, Stellar's reputation for **enterprise compliance** and **institutional trust** removes friction that more volatile, retail-heavy chains introduce.

## 🧠 Smart Contract Architecture

### Contract: `HavenRegistry`

| Module | Functions | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **`device.rs`** | `register_device()`, `get_device()` | Ingests SHA-256 hashed IMEI, creates `DeviceState`, increments device counter |
| **`killswitch.rs`** | `report_stolen()`, `get_bounty()` | Flips `is_stolen`, stores recovery contact, records bounty escrow amount |
| **`recovery.rs`** | `confirm_recovery()` | Flips `is_stolen` back, releases escrowed bounty to finder's address |
| **`insurance.rs`** | `file_insurance_claim()` | Transfers device authority to insurer, creates immutable proof-of-loss |

### `DeviceState` (On-Chain)

```rust
pub struct DeviceState {
    pub owner: Address,           // Device owner's Stellar address
    pub hashed_imei: BytesN<32>,  // SHA-256 hash (raw IMEI never on-chain)
    pub device_model: String,     // "iPhone 15 Pro", "Samsung Galaxy S24"
    pub is_stolen: bool,          // The killswitch flag
    pub registered_at: u32,       // Ledger sequence at registration
    pub recovery_contact: String, // Email/phone for finder to reach owner
    pub insurer: Option<Address>, // Set when insurance claim is filed
}
```

### Storage Keys

```rust
pub enum DataKey {
    Admin,                    // Contract administrator
    Device(BytesN<32>),       // Hashed IMEI → DeviceState
    Bounty(BytesN<32>),       // Hashed IMEI → Escrowed amount
    DeviceCount,              // Total registered devices
}
```

### Contract Events for Indexers

Haven indexers should subscribe to the Haven Registry contract and parse events
by topic. The raw IMEI is never emitted; event payloads use the same
`hashed_imei: BytesN<32>` value stored in `DataKey::Device`.

See [docs/EVENTS.md](./docs/EVENTS.md) for examples and integration notes.

| Event | Status | Emitted by | Topics | Payload |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|---------|
| `DeviceRegistered` | Implemented | `register_device()` in `device.rs` | `(dev_reg, register)` | `(hashed_imei: BytesN<32>, owner: Address, device_model: String)` |
| `DeviceStolen` | Planned | `report_stolen()` in `killswitch.rs` | `(stolen)` | `(hashed_imei: BytesN<32>, bounty_amount: i128)` |
| `DeviceRecovered` | Planned | `confirm_recovery()` in `recovery.rs` | `(recovered)` | `(hashed_imei: BytesN<32>, finder: Address)` |
| `InsuranceClaimed` | Planned | `file_insurance_claim()` in `insurance.rs` | `(insured)` | `(hashed_imei: BytesN<32>, insurer: Address)` |

Indexer guidance:
- Treat `DeviceRegistered` as the source of truth for initial owner and device model indexing.
- Treat the planned lifecycle events as the public contract for future event work already marked by TODOs in the module files.
- Join lifecycle events back to device state with `hashed_imei`; do not expect raw IMEI or PII in topics or payloads.
- Read `get_device(hashed_imei)` after a lifecycle event when an indexer needs the complete `DeviceState`.
